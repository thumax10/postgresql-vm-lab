# postgresql-vm-lab
This project is part of my bachelor thesis on the topic "Operating Databases in Kubernetes". This project is about creating a VM environment to install Postgresql and Patroni on it. In the following it will be used to have a lab environment to compare the installation between VM and Kubernetes and to do different tests.
